# Cassandra schema files

We put Cassandra schema files here for a while just to make sure we are not missing any bits and pieces.
This should eventually go into separate sub-project with some database schema evolution tool taking care on migrations.
For now we just put files in order they need to be applied and provided trivial script which is used on our container-based infrastructure to deal with freshly created sandboxes.
